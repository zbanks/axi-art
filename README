Description
===========

300 randomly sampled points visualized 3 ways. Points sampled with Poisson-disc sampling.

Panel One
---------

Points connected with both their minimum-spanning tree as well as their Steiner tree.

Panel Two
---------

Voronoi diagram of the source points.

Panel Three
-----------

The cells of the Voronoi diagram are 4-colored with the following four styles:

* Blank
* Polygon outline of Voronoi ridge verticies
* Star polygon ({n/2}) of Voronoi ridge verticies
* Line segments connecting each point to all of its Voronoi ridge veritices
